Feature: Exponential
	In order to avoid silly mistakes
	As a math idiot
	I want to be told the exponential of two numbers

@mytag
Scenario: First number to the power of second number
	Given the first number is 2
	And the second number is 6
	When the first number is to the power of second number
	Then the result should be 64
